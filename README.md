System info for Ubuntu
Tested only on Ubuntu no guarantee if its gonna work for all Linux systems.

Depends on lshw, lscpu and dialog (for TUI)

Sudo privileges needed for lshw to fully function.

Because of modular design other system info can be pulled with very simple manipulations of *_init and *_info functions.
